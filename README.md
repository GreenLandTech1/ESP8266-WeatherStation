# Dashboard Meteo React with ESP8266

## ESP8266-WeatherStation
WeatherStation with ESP8266 Board

### Implement ESP8266 IoT Based Projects.
Code of project with 4-5 I/O (modules/sensors).

Complete Description :
I would like IoT system to communicate by Wifi with database using REST APIs(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to record and consume data sensors (Temperature, pressure, altitude, light intensity & humidity).

#### Microcontrollers:
----------------
ESP8266

#### Platforms:
----------
Arduino IDE

#### Sensors / Inputs:
----------------
GY-30 BH1750FVI Digital light intensity sensor
DHT11 digital temperature and humidity sensor
BMP180 Digital Barometric Pressure Temperature et l'Altitude Sensor

#### Outputs:
-------
Arduino 4 Relays Shield to Control peristaltic pump

#### Wireless Communication protocols:
--------------------------------
Communicate WiFi boards with database using REST APIs(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

#### Databases:
---------
MySQL

## Details
Here is your schematic code and PHP file. Create a database with name myDatabase and place the PHP file in server. Add your username and password of database in PHP file. In code, add your router SSID/PASSWORD and server IP where mentioned in starting lines, Make these changes, upload the code and let me know if you face any issue.
